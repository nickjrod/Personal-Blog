# Base

**A solid base to establish your favorite websites with user experience in mind.**

Inspired by the user's own experience needs, we decided to implement a design system to serve as a solid basis for very simple, yet elegant websites to deliver a complexity-free environment.

## Main Features

* Supports native CSS variables.
* Works well with SVG out of the box.
* Offers some of the simplistic UI elements out there.
* Intelligent grid system based on Flex-box.
* Built using Stylus preprocessor.
* User-friendly documentation with editable code snippets.

## Getting Started

### Installation

Using npm

```bash
npm install @baianat/Base.framework --save
#or using yarn
yarn add @baianat/Base.framework
```

```html
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">

    <!-- Base -->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="./@baianat/framework/dist/css/base.css">

    <!-->Or if you want to use cssVar version <-->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="./@baianat/framework/dist/css/Base.cssvar.css">

```

### Webpack Configuration

Add the following rule to the Webpack configuration file

### Working with styles

In your main styling file `app.styl`, before including the Base main file, make sure to add the needed variables, according to your customization preferences.

```CSS
$margin = 2px
$red    = #E13C31
@import "~@baianat/Base.framework/base"
```
